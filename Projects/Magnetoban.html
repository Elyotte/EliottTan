    <h1>Magnetoban - Sokoban</h1>
    <div>
      <p>A Sokoban-style puzzle game developed in a team of five at ISART Digital between January and April 2023.</p>
      <p>Each team member designed two levels, and three additional levels were generated by ChatGPT as part of a research project on Artificial Intelligence in game design.</p>
      <p>You play as Roboban, a small robot tasked with organizing metal crates in a warehouse.</p>
      <p>Using your magnetic body, you can attract crates to move them around — stack them in the right spots using as few moves as possible!</p>
    </div>
