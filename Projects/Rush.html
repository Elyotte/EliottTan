      <p>You’re in a sushi restaurant where the sushi are trying to escape from your plate!</p>
      <p>Fortunately, you have special tiles that let you redirect the sushi to safety.</p>
      <p>Srushi is a gameplay recreation inspired by RUSH from Two Tribes.</p>
      <p>The goal of this project was to analyze existing mechanics and improve upon them, focusing on game feel and visual presentation.</p>
